# The Recipie Folder

This folder allows you to load in your own recipie cards to automate the kitchen in an unattended manner.  Examples have been provided for you (postfixed by ``.example``) that you can modify as you need.

## Recipie Cards

### ``armbian.conf``

This is a armbian build configuration file.  You can take a look at [Build Options](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Build-Options/) in the [Armbian Developer Documentation](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Welcome/) to learn more about available options.

These options are passed directly to ``compile.sh`` from the [Armbian Build Framework](https://github.com/armbian/build) at runtime.

### ``userpatches/``

This folder allows you to make userpatch customizations.  You can have a look at [User Configurations](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_User-Configurations/) in the [Armbian Developer Documentation](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Welcome/) to learn more about what this folder is for.
